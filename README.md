# Time_series_classification_for_EEG_activity_recognition

This is a CNN-based time series classifier used for human activity recognition using EEG signal data obtained from a Emotic Epoc+ headset. The paper referred to for the purpose is [http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/XLLI/publication/HARcnn.pdf](**Deep Convolutional Neural Networks On Multichannel Time Series For Human Activity Recognition**).
